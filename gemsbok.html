                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to the 
                    arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert and parts
                    of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. Known for its striking appearance,
                    the gemsbok features long, straight horns (present in both males and females), 
                    a robust build, and distinctive black-and-white facial markings that contrast sharply
                    against its pale, sandy-colored body. These antelope are incredibly well adapted to harsh 
                    desert climates, capable of surviving extreme heat and going for long periods without water
                    by relying on moisture from the plants they eat. 
                    Their horns, which can reach up to 85 cm in length, are not just for showâ€”gemsbok are known to fiercely
                    defend themselves against predators such as lions and hyenas using swift and powerful thrusts.</p>

     <p>Social by nature, gemsbok typically live in herds of 10 to 40 individuals, although older males
        may sometimes lead more solitary lives. They feed primarily on grasses, roots, and wild melons, 
        adjusting their diet according to the seasons and available vegetation. Despite their desert habitat, 
        gemsbok are remarkably efficient foragers and can detect underground tubers and water-rich plants. 
        These antelope play a vital role in their ecosystem, not only as grazers but also as prey for larger 
        carnivores. Symbolically, the gemsbok is a powerful icon of resilience and beauty in African wildlife, 
        often associated with survival and strength in local folklore and conservation efforts.

   <p>Gemsbok are found in the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in the Kalahari Desert and parts of Namibia,
    Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
