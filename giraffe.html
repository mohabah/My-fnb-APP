                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest living terrestrial animal and is native to the savannas and open woodlands of Africa. 
                    Giraffes are known for their long necks, which can reach up to 6 feet in length, and their distinctive coat patterns, which consist of irregular brown patches separated by lighter-colored fur.</p>

     <p>Social by nature, giraffes typically live in loose herds of 10 to 20 individuals, although group sizes can vary. They are herbivorous, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. Giraffes play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of their habitat through their feeding habits.</p>
        <p>Giraffes are known for their unique locomotion, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which gives them a distinctive gait. Despite their size, giraffes are generally gentle and non-aggressive animals, although they can defend themselves if threatened.</p>

   <p>Giraffes are found in the savannas and open woodlands of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
