                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>The gorilla (Gorilla spp.) is the largest living primate and is native to the forests of central Africa. 
                    There are two species of gorillas: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, both of which are critically endangered. 
                    Gorillas are known for their impressive size, with males weighing up to 200 kg (440 lbs) and standing over 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall when upright. 
                    They have a robust build, with broad chests, long arms, and a distinctive facial structure characterized by a prominent brow ridge and large nostrils.</p>

     <p>Social by nature, gorillas typically live in groups called troops, which are led by a dominant silverback male. These troops can consist of several females and their offspring. 
        Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a diet of leaves, stems, fruit, and flowers. They play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to disperse seeds and maintain the health of their forest habitat.</p>
        <p>Gorillas are known for their intelligence and complex social behaviors, including communication through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. 
            They are also capable of using tools, such as using sticks to extract termites from mounds. Despite their gentle nature, gorillas can be aggressive when threatened, especially in defense of their troop.</p>

   <p>Gorillas are found in the forests of central Africa, particularly in the Congo Basin and parts of Uganda, Rwanda, and Cameroon.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
