                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are adorable marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling habits.</p>
                    <p>Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their
                     adorable appearance and unique lifestyle. They are often referred to as "koala bears," although
                     they are not bears at all but rather belong to the marsupial family.</p>
     <p>Koalas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their large, round face and
     fluffy ears. They have a stocky body covered in thick, soft fur that helps to insulate them from
     the cold. Koalas are well adapted to their arboreal lifestyle, with strong limbs and sharp claws
     for climbing trees. They primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals,
     but koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify and extract nutrients
     from these leaves.</p>

   <p>Koalas are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
