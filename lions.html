                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species of large cat found in Africa and parts of Asia. 
                    Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are social animals that live in groups called prides, 
                    which typically consist of related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males.</p>

     <p>All lions have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
     mane of hair around their heads, which is more pronounced in males. This mane serves
    as a symbol of strength and helps to protect their necks during fights. Lions have powerful
    bodies, with strong legs and sharp claws, making them formidable hunters. Their social structure
    is unique among big cats, as they live in groups called prides, which provide protection and
    support for raising young.</p>

   <p>Lions are carnivorous and primarily hunt large herbivores such as wildebeest, zebras, and buffalo.
    They prefer open savannahs and grasslands, where they can use their strength and teamwork to
    take down prey. Lions are known for their impressive roars, which can be heard from miles away
    and serve to communicate with other members of the pride.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
