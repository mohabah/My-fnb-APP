                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are a group of primates that are typically characterized by their long tails, agile limbs, and playful behavior. They are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions. Monkeys are highly social animals and often live in troops or groups.</p>

     <p>All monkeys have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their long
     tails, which help them balance while climbing. They have flexible limbs and grasping hands
    with opposable thumbs, allowing them to swing through trees and manipulate objects with ease.
    Monkeys are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities, often using tools
    to obtain food or navigate their environment.</p>

   <p>Monkeys are omnivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
