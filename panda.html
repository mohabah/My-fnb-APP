                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are large mammals belonging to the family Ursidae and the order Carnivora. They are native to China and are known for their distinctive black and white coloring. There are two species of pandas: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the red panda (Ailurus fulgens). Giant pandas primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountains of central China, while red pandas are found in the temperate forests of the Himalayas and southwestern China.</p>

     <p>Pandas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their large size and unique coloration. They have a round face with black patches around their eyes, and their bodies are covered in thick, coarse fur that helps to insulate them in their cool, mountainous habitats.</p>

   <p>Pandas are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    bamboo forests, temperate forests, and mountainous regions. They prefer to stay near
    areas with abundant bamboo, which makes up the majority of their diet.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
